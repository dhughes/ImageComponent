known issues:

Some systems with very minimal (router-like) installations can not use the component.  They get messages like:
/opt/coldfusionmx/runtime/jre/lib/i386/libawt.so: libXp.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
This appears to be due to dependencies which Java.awt has on the underlying system

Images turning red -- appears to be due to limitations in the java imagereaders.  I fixed this by dropping in the JAI classes.

Color channels being swapped (red and blue, I think) -- havn't found or fixed yet
