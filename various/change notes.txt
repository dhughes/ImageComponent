Notes on things to change in documentation:

1) make sure it's clear that this documentation is for the Lite version

2) upsell the full version whereever possible

3) change the "Installation of the Image Component" section so that it's clear
that people will be working with data from MacromMedia.com

4) The big example of advanced strings had parts removed.  Update this to reflect the changes

stoped reading at page 22 (of lite docs)

Need to add notes in the documentation under any method which calls applyLookupTable that they do not work for indexed images and will throw errors.
